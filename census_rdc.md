I think the best way to get access to the Numident is to put together a Research Data Center project (https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/).  I don't see the Numident listed under "Available Data" on the website, but I know of RDC projects that have used it.  If you know Trent Alexander in CARRA, he is probably the best person to ask about getting access (and speeding up the approval process, potentially), as a part of the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP).  This is the larger project my work with Joe and Catherine has been a part of.  I think you would need to make a proposal under this project because of the need to have access to the internal 1940 data with PIKs to link to the Numident.  I would be happy to chat informally about my understanding of the process, but I will confess that much of my information about external access is second-hand and is subject to measurement error.

> In Ferrie et al, you matched only a subset of women in 1940 using Numident; was that only a subset because some of the 1940 women didn't apply for an SSN or because the Numident file (or the version for use at least) doesn't include every person in 1940 who was issued an SSN?

The bigger issue is that not all people can be matched to the Numident successfully even if they are in both datasets.  However, it is an issue for 1940 adults that some didn't get SSNs.  The Numident should include all individuals with SSNs (with the caveat that errors can be present in admin data as well).

### RDC Introduction

Source: https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/

Before submitting, consult
- RDC Location
  - There is an RDC at the NBER that (I think) we'll be able to use for free as NBER FRF or whatever we are. (https://www.census.gov/about/adrm/fsrdc/locations/boston.html)
- Research Proposal Guidelines (https://www.census.gov/ces/pdf/Research_Proposal_Guidelines.pdf)
  - See also the preliminary proposal template
    - https://www.census.gov/ces/rtf/RDC_Preliminary_Proposal_Template.rtf
  - See also the predominant purpose statement template
    - https://www.census.gov/ces/rtf/RDC_Predominant_Purpose_Statement_Template.rtf
- Writing Benefit Statements for Projects Accessing Confidential Data
  - https://www.census.gov/ces/pdf/Writing_Benefit_Statements.pdf
- IRS data
  - https://www.census.gov/ces/pdf/IRS_Criteria_Document.pdf
  - not relevant for us

Proposals must
- Provide benefit to Census Bureau programs
- Demonstrate scientific merit
- Require nonâ€“public data
- Be feasible given the data
- Pose no risk of disclosure

#### Census RDC Research Proposal Guidelines

- We submit with our administrator (James Davis @ NBER). Presumably he has a ton of experience with this.
- Researchers must complete background investigation (can take a number of months)

Preliminary Proposal Development
- First contact admin at NBER. Go over the 5 proposal req's above.
- We then complete Attachment 1: Preliminary Proposal (in here: https://www.census.gov/ces/pdf/Research_Proposal_Guidelines.pdf).
  - Time extensions are hard to get
  - Typical project is 36 months and longer is hard to get
  - So let's just ask for 36 months (or less if we are really confident)
- What's in the preliminary?
  - Title, Names, Dates, Duration, Funding, Description, Census Datasets, Years of Data, RDC Location, Benefits
  - Description is 2 or 3 sentences
  - Benefits are just numbers from list of benefits

Final Proposal Submission
This comes after submitting the preliminary proposal above (after CES approves the idea in general, I suppose).

Proposal Content Guidelines
- Project Description
  - research question
  - methodology
  - census and non-census data to be used
  - outcomes
  - references
  - "Though the benefits to Census are presented in a separate proposal document (discussed in the next section), you should integrate into the proposal as appropriate how your research benefits the Census Bureau."
  - some formatting (see page 2), including
    - title and names of researchers on the top of the first page
    - no appendices
    - no more than 15 pages (single spaced)
    - Min font 11, .5 margins but font 12 and 1 inch margins preferred
    - page numbers
    - RTF, DOC, DOCX (so no latex)
  - In the "Sections" section there is a lot of detail about what to include in each part of the proposal (serious minutia)
- Benefits Statement
  - research is likely to provide one or more Title 13 benefits to the Census Bureau
  - Do we do any of these?
    1. Evaluating concepts and practices underlying Census Bureau statistical data collection and dissemination practices, including consideration of continued relevance and appropriateness of past Census Bureau procedures to changing economic and social circumstances;
    2. Analyzing demographic and social or economic processes that affect Census Bureau programs, especially those that evaluate or hold promise of improving the quality of products issued by the Census Bureau;
    3. Developing means of increasing the utility of Census Bureau data for analyzing public programs, public policy, and/or demographic, economic, or social conditions; and
    4. Conducting or facilitating census and survey data collection, processing or dissemination, including through activities such as administrative support, information technology support, program oversight, or auditing under appropriate legal authority
- Abstract
  - One page, capture the essence.
  - Also should address the proposed benefits

After Approval
- Background check!
  - fingerprints
- Grants Special Sworn Status (SSS)

#### Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP)

- https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2015/adrm/2015-alexander.pdf
  - The core linkable data files consist of the 1940 Census, the 2000 Census, the 2010
Census, the American Community Survey, and the Current Population Survey.
  - doesn't mention numident explicitly in the abstract but it is the backbone
  - Figure 1 shows the data infrastructure
    - "The CLIPP team will assign PIKs to these files and integrate them into the CLIPP infrastructure."
    - Seems like we could give them the 1920 data and ask to get it PIK'ed and then (in the RDC) we could link on PIKs to 1940
